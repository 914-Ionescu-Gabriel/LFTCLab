The FiniteAutomaton struct represents a M = (Q,Σ,δ,p,F) finite automaton.
The Transition struct represents a δ(p,a) = q transition.

The displayElemennts function is used by the main menu to display individual characteristics of the finite automaton read.
The isSequenceAccepted function takes in the stored finite automaton and an input sequence and check if said sequence is accepted fy the finite automaton.
The reading of the finite automaton and populating the struct types is done on start from the FA.in file.

The formatting of the FA.in file:
	states_list = [states_list","] state
	states = "states=" states_list "\n"
	alphabet_list = [alphabet_list","] terminal
	alphabet = "alphabet=" alphabet_list "\n"
	transition = state " " terminal " " state
	transitions = "transitions=" transition_list "\n"
	initialState = "initialState=" state "\n"
	finalState= "finalState=" states_list
